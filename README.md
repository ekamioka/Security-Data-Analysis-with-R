# Security-Data-Analysis-with-R
A series of labs that will help users apply various data science techniques to security related data. Based on Mike Sconzo and David Dorsey work with ML in Python.

## Introduction

This is a R language re-written of a two day class of Machine Learning in Python that [Mike Sconzo](https://twitter.com/sooshie) and [David Dorsey](https://twitter.com/trogdorsey) gave as a workshop at BSidesDFW. The original repository can be found here: https://github.com/sooshie/Security-Data-Analysis

The goal over the analysis will be to demonstrate doing data analysis as well as machine learning in R language with IT security data sets. 

Thank you Mike Sconzo and David Dorsey for the initial work and inspiration!!!
